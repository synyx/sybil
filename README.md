## Working so far

* Reads configuration from JSON files.
* Outputs statuses on LED strips.
    * Outputs statuses of Jenkins build jobs, updated every 60 seconds.
* Outputs arbitrary pixels and sprites on LED strips.
    * Does this via a HTTP API.
* Serves a *very barebones* REST API showing the configured the bricks and bricklets. 

## Execution

### Configuration

To run or deploy the server you need `bricks.json`, `ledstrips.json`, and `jenkins.json` in `/home/sybil-config/`, and
`jenkinsservers.json` in `/home/sybil/`.  
See `docs/configfiles` for examples and simplified schemata.  
The locations of these configuration files can be configured in `src/main/resources/config.properties`.  

Note that all the names used in the configuration files *must* be lowercase.

### Running

To run the server:

`gradlew appRun`

### Deployment

#### Standalone

Run

`gradlew buildProduct`

and it will produce a self-contained web-app with all the required dependencies in `build/output/sybil`, that can run
on any computer that has Java 8 installed.

Copy this directory to wherever you want to deploy Sybil and run

`start.sh` or `start.bat`.

Run

`restart.sh` or `restart.bat`

to restart the server or

`stop.sh` or `stop.bat`

to stop the server.

#### With an application server

Run 

`gradlew build`

and copy the war file from `build/libs/` to an application server of your choice.

### Debugging

First run

`gradlew appStartDebug`

Now connect your debugger to port 5005.

e.g. in IntelliJ IDEA create a Run Configuration of type `Remote`, leave all the defaults.
Now you can run this Configuration with the Debug command.

When you are done, run

`gradlew appStop`

## How to use

The Servlet Container loads the configurations from **AppInitializer**, since it extends a ServletInitializer.  
This then loads:

* The **WebConfig** class.
    * Which in turn loads all the __*Controller__ classes, since they're annotated with @RestController
* The Spring configuration in **SpringConfig**, which loads:
    * All the __*Service__ classes, since they're annotated with @Service.

The **JenkinsService** has a *runEveryMinute* method, which is annotated with @Scheduled which means it is run every 60
seconds. This method gets a list of all jobs from the Jenkins server(s), compares it to the list loaded from
`jenkins.json` and then instructs the associated LED strips to show the jobs' statuses. 

Bricks configured in the JSON files can be listed via the REST API at `/configuration/bricks` and
`/configuration/bricks/{name}` respectively. Same goes for LED strips at `/configuration/ledstrips` and 
`/configuration/ledstrips/{name}`.

A direct API for reading the LED strips' state and for writing to it (i.e. displaying things on it) is provided at
`/configuration/ledstrips/{name}/display/`.

For further information on this see [the wiki](https://github.com/synyx/sybil-wiki).

### Extending Sybil

If you want to extend Sybil's functionality, here's how you operate it "manually":

First, use the **LEDStripDTOService**'s *getDTO* method, to get a DTO, pre-configured with the configuration loaded from
`ledstrips.json`. Then use the DTO's *setSprite* or *setStatus* methods to add either a sprite or a status to the DTO,
and pass it to the corresponding method of the **LEDStripServic**, i.e. either *handleSprite* or *handleStatus*.

If you want to add support for further hardware, try to replicate this pattern.
