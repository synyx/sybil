synyx BÃ¼ro - Information & Licht
--------------------------------

A project to illuminate and inform the people in the office(s).
Uses WS2812 LED Strips connected to Tinkerforge bricks.

### Working so far ###

* Outputs Statuses on LED Strips via Tinkerforge (see integration test org.synyx.sybil.out.SingleStatusOnLEDStripTest)
* Outputs arbitrary pixels and sprites " " (see integration test org.synyx.sybil.out.OutputLEDStripTest)

To run, run an integration test, e.g.:

gradlew integTest --tests org.synyx.sybil.out.OutputLEDStripTest

The Spring configuratin in o.s.s.config.SpringConfig loads:

* All the ***Registry** classes, since they're annotated with @Service
* The database configuration from **o.s.s.config.Neo4jConfig**
* Which in turn loads the ***Repository** and ***Domain** classes.

Now you can create new **BrickDomain**s with a host and - optionally - a port.
Save those to the **BrickRepository** with it's *save* method.  
Create new **OutputLEDStripDomain**s with a name to identify the Output, a Bricklet's UID, the number of LEDs on the 
Strip and the **BrickDomain** you created earlier.
Save these to the **OutputLEDStripRepository** with it's *save* method.  
Now you are ready to get an **OutputLEDStrip** from the **OutputLEDStripRegistry** with it's *get* method, to
which you pass the **OutputLEDStripDomain**, which you either have left over from creating them for the database, or you
fetch them fresh from the database with **OutputLEDStripRepository**'s *findByName* method. 

Look at **o.s.s.out.OutputLEDStrip** to see what you can do with it.
